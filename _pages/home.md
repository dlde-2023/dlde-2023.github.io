<p>
In the deep learning community, a remarkable trend is emerging, where powerful architectures are created by leveraging classical mathematical modeling tools from diverse fields like differential equations, signal processing, and dynamical systems. Differential equations are a prime example: research on neural differential equations has expanded to include a large zoo of related models with applications ranging from time series analysis to robotics control. Score-based diffusion models are among state-of-the-art tools for generative modelling, drawing connections between diffusion models and neural differential equations. Other examples of deep architectures with important ties to classical fields of mathematical modelling include normalizing flows, graph neural diffusion models, Fourier neural operators, architectures exhibiting domain-specific equivariances, and latent dynamical models (e.g., latent NDEs, H3, S4, Hyena).
</p>

<p>
The previous two editions of the Workshop on the Symbiosis of Deep Learning and Differential Equations have promoted the bidirectional exchange of ideas at the intersection of classical mathematical modelling and modern deep learning. On the one hand, this includes the use of differential equations and similar tools to create neural architectures, accelerate deep learning optimization problems, or study theoretical problems in deep learning. On the other hand, the Workshop also explores the use of deep learning methods to improve the speed, flexibility, or realism of computer simulations. 
Responding to demand from last year's attendees, <b>this year's edition will place a special focus on neural architectures that leverage classical mathematical models, such as those listed above.</b>

</p>

  <p> <span style="font-weight:500;">Submission:</span>
  <br/>
    Accepted submissions will be presented during joint poster sessions and will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing future submissions to archival conferences or journals. 
    Exceptional submissions will be selected for spotlight talks. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Submissions should be up to 4 pages excluding references, acknowledgements, and supplementary material, and should be
      <span style="color:#3a92d6;font-weight:400;"><a href="https://github.com/dlde-2023/dlde-2023.github.io/tree/master/static/sty/dlde_neurips_2023.sty">DLDE-NeurIPS format</a></span> and anonymous. Long appendices are permitted but strongly discouraged, and reviewers are not required to read them. The review process is double-blind.
  </p>
  <p>
  We also welcome submissions of recently published work that is strongly within the scope of the workshop (with proper formatting). We encourage the authors of such submissions to focus on accessibility to the wider NeurIPS community while distilling their work into an extended abstract. Submission of this type will be eligible for poster sessions after a lighter review process.
  </p>
  <p>
  Authors may be asked to review other workshop submissions.
